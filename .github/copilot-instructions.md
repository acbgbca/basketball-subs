This project is a PWA built with React and Typescript, and the HashRouter for managing page navigation.

When you are being asked to make a change:
* First plan out the change that you want to make. Present it to me and confirm whether to continue.
* Break the plan into smaller self contained parts.
* Make one change at a time. Make sure it works with test coverage before moving onto the next part.
* If the tests fail, you may make one attempt to fix them. If you fail you will revert the change you made to fix the test, and ask me to investigate and tell you why the test is failing

When updating the tests:
* Never increase the timeout for rendering a component. If the component doesn't render in time, then something is wrong
